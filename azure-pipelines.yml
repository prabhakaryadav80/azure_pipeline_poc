# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

variables:
 GLOBAL_MYSECRET: $(mySecret) # this will not work because the secret variable needs to be mapped as env
 GLOBAL_MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR: $(nonSecretVariable) # this works because it's not a secret.

steps:
- task: DownloadSecureFile@1
  name: ssh_private_key
  inputs:
    secureFile: secure_file

- bash : |
    echo $(ssh_private_key.secureFilePath)
    cat $(ssh_private_key.secureFilePath)
